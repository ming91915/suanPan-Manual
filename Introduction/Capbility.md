=========

suanPan currently supports analysis of

-   Linear/Nonlienar Statics
-   Linear/Nonlienar Dynamics
-   Eigenproblems

The solving schemes covered are

-   Multi-Point Load Control (Statics/Dynamics)
-   Multi-Point Displacement Control (Statics/Dynamics)
-   Single-Point Arc Length Control (Statics)

Those solving schemes can be combined with either classic Newton method or quasi-Newton method such as the rank two update BFGS method.

If the element is properly implemented, users can also run nonlinear geometry analysis.
